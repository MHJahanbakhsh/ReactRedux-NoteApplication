# react-redux-Note-Application-
a fully functional note application(including authentication and all CRUD tasks)   

---

## __Note:__ i deployed the server on heroku. heroku is restricted in certain countries(including iran).so use vpn in that case
## technologies:
* React(both class-based and hooks)
* Redux
* redux-form
* redux-thunk
* google oauth
* bootstrap
* JSON-server api
---
* you must sign in via your google acount to be able to use app
* for simplicity and solely focus on frontend logic i used `JSON-server` as backend.changes on json database is not consistent and gets reset after a while.so keep that in mind
